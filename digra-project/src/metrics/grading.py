Answer grading.

Why this is its own module
---------------------------
Both the response-pool builder (Appendix B-3 — deciding which of 50 sampled
responses are "correct") and the later debate metrics (MA/MR/IMR/CR — Eq.
1-5, which all reduce to per-round correctness) need the exact same
correctness judgment. Splitting it out means both consumers can never
silently disagree about what "correct" means.

Approach: normalize (lowercase, strip punctuation/articles, collapse
whitespace) both the prediction and every accepted gold phrasing, then
check containment of the normalized gold string within the normalized
prediction. Containment (not exact match) is used because model responses
are typically full sentences ("The answer is Yale.") rather than bare
answers, and short free-text QA gold answers are rarely full sentences.

This is a heuristic, not a solved problem — flagged explicitly here rather
than presented as exact. Before trusting it on a real run, sanity-check
`is_correct` by hand against ~20 real model outputs per dataset (see
project README / step "6.7" in the project plan) before relying on it.
