"""
Pool-building orchestration (Appendix B-3, full procedure).

This is the thin layer that actually calls a model, but it depends only on
the LLMClient interface (src/llm/client.py) — so every branch of the
step-2/step-3 logic is exercised in tests/test_pool_generation.py using
FakeLLMClient, with zero GPU involved. Only the concrete VLLMClient
implementation (src/llm/vllm_client.py) remains unverified until Kaggle.

    Full Appendix B-3 procedure for one question:
      step 1: sample the neutral prompt n_attempts times.
      step 2: if >= n_all came back correct, randomly retain n_all.
      step 3: otherwise, keep all correct ones, then generate exactly the
              shortfall via a single guided (few-shot + gold-answer) batch,

    return exactly k completions (see src/llm/client.py), so step 3 always
    exactly fills the shortfall in one batch — there is no retry loop here,
    because one would never have anything to do. `fully_satisfied` is kept
    as a defensive check only, in case a future LLMClient implementation
    ever violates that contract.
